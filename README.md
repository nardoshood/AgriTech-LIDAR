# AgriTech-LIDAR
A task to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. 


AgriTech is interested in how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help improve the research on new agricultural products being tested on farms.

How much maize a field produces is very spatially variable. Even if the same farming practices, seeds and fertilizer are applied exactly the same by machinery over a field, there can be a very large harvest at one corner and a low harvest at another corner.  To be able to better understand which parts of the farm are likely to produce more or less maize is great, so that if a new fertilizer is tested on part of this farm, any differences in the maize harvest are due mostly to the new fertilizer changes, and not just random effects due to other environmental factors.  

 As part of the data engineering team in AgriTech, we are tasked to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data.
